   year = {2020},
   abstract = {The  city  of  Christchurch,  New  Zealand  experienced  four  major  earthquakes  (MW  >  5.9)  and  multiple  aftershocks between 4 September 2010 and 23 December 2011. This series of earthquakes, commonly known as  the  Canterbury  Earthquake  Sequence  (CES),   induced over  NZ$40  billion  in  total  economic  losses. Liquefaction alone led to building damage in 51,000 of the 140,000 residential buildings, with around 15,000 houses left unpractical to  repair. Widespread damage to residential buildings highlighted the need for improved seismic prediction tools and to better understand factors influencing damage. Fortunately, due to New Zealand unique insurance setting, up to 80% of the losses were insured. Over the entire CES, insurers received more than 650,000 claims. This research project employs multi-disciplinary empirical data gathered during and prior to the CES to develop a seismic loss prediction model for residential buildings in Christchurch using machine learning.  The  intent  is  to develop  a  procedure  for  developing  insights  from  post-earthquake  data  that  is  subjected to continuous updating, to enable identification of critical parameters affecting losses, and to apply such a model to establish priority building stock for risk mitigation measures. The following paper describes the complex data preparation process required for the application of machine learning techniques. The paper covers the production of a merged dataset with information from the Earthquake Commission (EQC) claim database,  building characteristics from RiskScape, seismic demand interpolated from GeoNet strong motion records, liquefaction occurrence from the New Zealand Geotechnical Database (NZGD)  and soil conditions from Land Resource Information Systems (LRIS).},

   abstract = {In 2010–2011, New Zealand experienced the most damagingearthquakes in its history. It led to extensive damage to Christchurchbuildings, infrastructure and its surroundings; affecting commercial andresidential buildings. The direct economic losses represented 20% of NewZealand’s GDP in 2011. Owing to New Zealand’s particular insurancestructure, the insurance sector contributed to over 80% of losses for atotal of more than NZ$31 billion. Amongst this, over NZ$11 billion ofthe losses arose from residential building claims and were covered eitherpartially or entirely from the NZ government backed Earthquake Com-mission (EQC) cover insurance scheme. In the process of resolving theclaims, EQC collected detailed financial loss data, post-event observa-tions and building characteristics for each of the approximately 434,000claims  lodged  following  the  Canterbury  Earthquake  sequence  (CES).Added to this, the active NZ earthquake engineering community treatedthe event as a large scale outdoor experiment and collected extensive dataon the ground shaking levels, soil conditions, and liquefaction occurrencethroughout wider Christchurch. This paper discusses the necessary datapreparation process preceding the development of a machine learningseismic loss model. The process draws heavily upon using GeographicInformation System (GIS) techniques to aggregate relevant informationfrom multiple databases interpolating data between categories and con-verting data between continuous and categorical forms. Subsequently,the database is processed, and a residential seismic loss prediction modelis developed using machine learning. The aim is to develop a ‘grey-box’model enabling human interpretability of the decision steps.}

   abstract = {The 2017 Puebla, Mexico, earthquake event led to significant damage in many buildings in Mexico City. In the months following the earthquake, civil engineering students conducted detailed building assessments throughout the city. They collected building damage information and structural characteristics for 340 buildings in the Mexico City urban area, with an emphasis on the Roma and Condesa neighborhoods where they assessed 237 buildings. These neighborhoods are of particular interest due to the availability of seismic records captured by nearby recording stations, and preexisting information from when the neighborhoods were affected by the 1985 Michoacán earthquake. This article presents a case study on developing a damage prediction model using machine learning. It details a framework suitable for working with future post-earthquake observation data. Four algorithms able to perform classification tasks were trialed. Random forest, the best performing algorithm, achieves more than 65% prediction accuracy. The study of the feature importance for the random forest shows that the building location, seismic demand, and building height are the parameters that influence the model output the most.},

   year = {2020},
   abstract = {In recent years, the system known as diagrid (diagonal grid) has been used in several tall buildings around the world. Despite the large advantages that the innovative structural system represents in terms of sustainability, its use has not been sufficiently studied for high seismicity zones. This paper develops a displacement-based methodology for the conception and preliminary performance-based seismic design of perimeter diagrid systems. The methodology applies to tall buildings, whose dynamic response is significantly influenced by global flexural drift deformations. The methodology is exemplified by the preliminary design of a 24-story building located in the soft soil condition of Mexico City. The paper provides some detailed background behind the performance-based design and highlights the benefit of simple, reasonable, and safe structural estimations in terms of the monetary and environmental cost. It is concluded first, that the proposed methodology yields diagonal grid systems that adequately satisfy predefined deterministic performance levels; and second, that a perimeter diagonal grid system is an attractive structural option for tall buildings located in high seismicity zones.}

   abstract = {Understanding seismic risk enables efficient resource allocation in the effort to increase the resilience of our cities and communities. Field reconnaissance and data collection following disasters document the damaging effects of earthquakes to enable lessons and wisdom to accumulate from past events. An important aim of such field data analysis is establishing a better understanding of building performance such as causes of building failures. These lessons provide essential basis to improve our design codes, develop regulations and policies, to increase building resilience by addressing the infrastructure vulnerability. Currently, to make use of the datasets from around the world, significant effort is required to decode the data which often have unique local and regional context and bias. The struggle begins at data collection where there is a lack of consistent methodology and definitions that can adequately cover the regional nuance. This manuscript proposes a new paper-based tool which addresses the need for a global yet detailed universal methodology for building damage assessment post-earthquakes. The new form is based on the GEM taxonomy v2.0 and the European Macroseismic Scale EMS-98. The recent Mexican earthquake from the 19 September 2017 led to significant building damage in the capital Mexico City and the state of Morelos. A team from New Zealand assessed damage throughout the capital and tested the new paper form in Calle La Morena. The street case study presents a novel visualization of the damage data and buildings characteristics which highlights the correlation between the damage and the building features. It is hoped that this kind of illustration will lead to better comprehension of the damage drivers.},

   abstract = {The magnitude 7.1 Puebla, Mexico earthquake of September 19th, 2017, centred 55 km south of the city of Puebla, led to significant and extensive damage in central Mexico, especially in Mexico City. One month after the event, a team of four researchers from New Zealand travelled to the affected area with the aim of enabling access to observational data that may be relevant to New Zealand’s own disaster mitigation effort. The NZ team was guided by local teams from the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana-Azcapotzalco (UAM), and they collaborated with the American Concrete Institute (ACI) Disaster Reconnaissance team and the Colegio de Ingenieros Civiles de Mexico (CICM) – Mexican Society of Civil Engineers. The NZ team actively took part in building assessments while conducting passive observations. Preliminary observations have revealed a concentration of building damage in the transition and soft soil zones (i.e. between hard and deep soils). Some areas within Mexico City suffered widespread and extensive damage, Coapa, Jardines de Coyoacan, Culhuacan and Narvarte neighbourhoods. In general, there were 38 collapsed and more than 3000 damaged buildings. Observations reinforce the significance of local site effects, the need of informed, targeted approach in wide-scale building assessments, and the potential role for building instrumentation. The mission provided opportunities to record the performance of various retrofit and repair techniques
   through examples that were installed following the 1985 Michoacán Earthquake. The team was jointly resourced by the NZ Society for Earthquake Engineering, the University of Auckland, the University of Canterbury, and Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana-Azcapotzalco.},
