   abstract = {The 2017 Puebla, Mexico, earthquake event led to significant damage in many buildings in Mexico City. In the months following the earthquake, civil engineering students conducted detailed building assessments throughout the city. They collected building damage information and structural characteristics for 340 buildings in the Mexico City urban area, with an emphasis on the Roma and Condesa neighborhoods where they assessed 237 buildings. These neighborhoods are of particular interest due to the availability of seismic records captured by nearby recording stations, and preexisting information from when the neighborhoods were affected by the 1985 Michoacán earthquake. This article presents a case study on developing a damage prediction model using machine learning. It details a framework suitable for working with future post-earthquake observation data. Four algorithms able to perform classification tasks were trialed. Random forest, the best performing algorithm, achieves more than 65% prediction accuracy. The study of the feature importance for the random forest shows that the building location, seismic demand, and building height are the parameters that influence the model output the most.},

   abstract = {Past seismic events have shown that economic losses following an earthquake disaster could significantly exceed any previous loss expectation. Modern engineering design methodologies define the seismic risk based on life safety criteria but do not explicitly specify the essential criteria leading to economic losses. This research attempts to identify the preponderant parameters effecting financial losses due to building damage following an earthquake event. Existing pre-event data collection frameworks are reviewed. A new approach based on the Pareto principle is introduced. Financial and structural survey data from the Christchurch earthquakes are analyzed with the purpose of identifying the principal sources of economic losses in buildings. As a result of the desktop study, a new post-earthquake assessment form based on the GEM building taxonomy is proposed. Remarks following its application in Mexico City following the 2017 Puebla earthquake are presented. Introduction},
