   abstract = {This report presents the observations and findings following the 2017 Puebla earthquake that occurred inMexico on September 19th, 2017. The reconnaissance mission was a collaboration between the New ZealandSociety of Earthquake Engineering (NZSEE), the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (UAM) Azcapotzalco,the American Concrete Institute (ACI) Disaster Reconnaissance team, and the Colegio de Ingenieros Civilesde Mexico (CICM). During the earthquake, 77 buildings suffered partial or total collapse and more than8,000 buildings experienced damage ranging from slight damage to significant structural damage necessitatingdemolition. As observed in previous earthquakes, the unique soil conditions of Mexico City resulted inextensive damage to the city’s infrastructure, primarily due to local site effects. The earthquake causedrelatively more damage to buildings built on transition and soft soil zones (i.e. between hard and deep softsoils) than those on hard soils.The NZSEE and UAM team focussed on areas with widespread and extensive damage. They also assessedthe performance of repaired and retrofitted buildings after the 1985 Michoacán earthquake. It was found thatthe lessons learnt from the 1985 Michoacán earthquake led to some risk mitigation measures which benefitedseveral buildings in the 2017 earthquake. Retrofitted buildings were found to have performed very well withlittle or no damage when compared to other buildings.},

   abstract = {The 2017 Puebla, Mexico, earthquake event led to significant damage in many buildings in Mexico City. In the months following the earthquake, civil engineering students conducted detailed building assessments throughout the city. They collected building damage information and structural characteristics for 340 buildings in the Mexico City urban area, with an emphasis on the Roma and Condesa neighborhoods where they assessed 237 buildings. These neighborhoods are of particular interest due to the availability of seismic records captured by nearby recording stations, and preexisting information from when the neighborhoods were affected by the 1985 Michoacán earthquake. This article presents a case study on developing a damage prediction model using machine learning. It details a framework suitable for working with future post-earthquake observation data. Four algorithms able to perform classification tasks were trialed. Random forest, the best performing algorithm, achieves more than 65% prediction accuracy. The study of the feature importance for the random forest shows that the building location, seismic demand, and building height are the parameters that influence the model output the most.},

@book{Roeslin2020,
   abstract = {In 2010–2011, New Zealand experienced the most damaging earthquakes in its history. It led to extensive damage to Christchurch buildings, infrastructure and its surroundings; affecting commercial and residential buildings. The direct economic losses represented 20% of New Zealand’s GDP in 2011. Owing to New Zealand’s particular insurance structure, the insurance sector contributed to over 80% of losses for a total of more than NZ$31 billion. Amongst this, over NZ$11 billion of the losses arose from residential building claims and were covered either partially or entirely from the NZ government backed Earthquake Commission (EQC) cover insurance scheme. In the process of resolving the claims, EQC collected detailed financial loss data, post-event observations and building characteristics for each of the approximately 434,000 claims lodged following the Canterbury Earthquake sequence (CES). Added to this, the active NZ earthquake engineering community treated the event as a large scale outdoor experiment and collected extensive data on the ground shaking levels, soil conditions, and liquefaction occurrence throughout wider Christchurch. This paper discusses the necessary data preparation process preceding the development of a machine learning seismic loss model. The process draws heavily upon using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to aggregate relevant information from multiple databases interpolating data between categories and converting data between continuous and categorical forms. Subsequently, the database is processed, and a residential seismic loss prediction model is developed using machine learning. The aim is to develop a ‘grey-box’ model enabling human interpretability of the decision steps.},
