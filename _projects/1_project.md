On 19 September 2017, a magnitude Mw 7.1 earthquake struck the central part of Mexico. It originated in the Puebla region and affected the Puebla, Morelos and Mexico City area. In the urban area, 77 buildings partially or totally collapsed, and 8,000 buildings experienced different levels of damage.

At the end of October 2017, a reconnaissance team from New Zealand spent about a week in Mexico City.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.
