I am happy to let you know that I started a trainee at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission in Ispra, Italy. I am working in the unit C.2 Energy Efficiency and Renewables in the European Solar Test Installation (ESTI) lab on the project: "Data analysis of the electrical output performance of bifacial photovoltaics (PV) devices under long-term outdoor conditions".
